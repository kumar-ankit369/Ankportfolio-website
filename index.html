            <h3>Breast Cancer Wisconsin</h3>
            <p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area. The key challenges against it‚Äôs detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous). We ask you to complete the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning (with SVMs) and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.</p>

 "Jeevan: 
Revolutionizing Life with the Potable Saline Water Model Sustainable Solutions." üíß

In the realm of water innovation, our project stands out as a beacon of hope for communities worldwide. Introducing the Potable Saline Water Model: a groundbreaking solution poised to redefine access to clean drinking water.

üíº Business Model: Our portable desalination unit, weighing under 10 kilograms, utilizes cutting-edge technology including ICP (Ion Concentration Polarization) and Electrodialysis to remove particles and salts from water, generating clean drinking water on the go.

üî¨ Cutting-Edge Technology: Leveraging the power of ICP (Ion Concentration Polarization) and Electrodialysis, our portable desalination unit is a testament to innovation at its finest. By removing particles and salts, it generates drinking water that not only meets but exceeds World Health Organization quality standards.
Solar-Powered and Sustainable: Embracing eco-conscious practices, our suitcase-sized device operates with minimal power consumption, akin to a cell phone charger. Plus, it can be effortlessly driven by a small, affordable solar panel, promoting sustainability and accessibility.

üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ User-Friendly Design: Simplifying the process of water purification, our technology is packaged into a user-friendly device. With just the push of a button, it automatically produces safe, clean drinking water, empowering communities with ease of use.

Join us on this journey of innovation and sustainability as we pave the way for a brighter, water-secure future. Together, let's make a tangible difference in the lives of millions! .</p>
